Methods and systems for managing financial data to measure the liquidity risk for a client involve, for example,implementing, using a computer having a processor coupled to memory, client-defined templates for a cash flow forecasting module. Also using the computer, forecast data for the client may be received via the client-defined templates by the cash flow forecasting module. Likewise using the computer, a real-time predictive aggregated measure of available cash flow for the client by currency by value date is generated by the cash flow forecasting module. In addition, a real time measure of forecast variance is computed by the cash flow forecasting module through pseudo logic matching of the actual cash flows at transaction level against the likely much higher level at which the forecasting process is operating.
